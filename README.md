## Sourcing real-time Club Football Player-based Goal Statistics in MATLAB
*Tl;dr: Goalmaal is a quick data scraper I wrote in MATLAB to source all 
club goal statistics for a specific football player.

I wanted to experiment a bit with Messi's goal statistics and find out some 
more insights about the players who have assisted him the most (It's not Dani 
Alves or Xavi or Iniesta!). Turns out that it's not so easy to directly get 
football goal data into MATLAB (I could be wrong about this, but I didn't find 
a quick solution) - so I wrote a quick scraper for collecting goal data given 
a player's name.

*Disclaimer: In this case, all the data is available thanks to the amazing 
folks at <https://www.transfermarkt.com/ transfermarkt.com> and I don't own 
any of it. Would have loved to see a filter on the website itself but here we 
are.
